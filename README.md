# QGIS RichDem

This plugin exposes [RichDem](richdem.com) hydrological analysis tools to QGIS. 

## installation

This plugin should be available from the QGIS repository. Install with the plugin installer.

QRichDem depends on RichDem, which it will try to install using pip to the system python (only dependency is numpy). This is suboptimal, and should be resolved [soon](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/202)


## use

Simply install the plugin. The RichDem menu should be added to the toolbox.
